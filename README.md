### Troubleshooting
If you get an error on your device like this: `"Unable to load script from assets index.android.bundle"` try the following:

```
$ adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
```
### Debugging
Shake your phone or navigate to the development menu and click on the `Debug JS remotely`. After this navigate to `http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui/` on your browser and open the dev tools. 

There is a great tool that combines React DevTools, Redux DevTools and the usual dev tools like console, network etc. which you can find here:

Happy debugging!
